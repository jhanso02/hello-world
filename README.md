# hello-world
Welcome to GitHub! Following the how to get started tutorial

I want to keep my coding skills fresh this summer and learn new programming languages!
So, of course I wanted to learn how to use GitHub.
I also love listening to Broadway musicals.
Can't wait to get back to school in the fall.
